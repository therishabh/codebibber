					<h2>
						Research
					</h2>
					<p>
						By researching users within the guidelines of their environment, 
						and collecting important information about the user to create a 
						well-informed view of the visual experience. Our in-depth product 
						research grows insights and brings light additional strategies. This 
						ensures ease of use of the design, and reduces the need for expensive 
						re-work before an investment is made in development. Ultimately, our 
						methods enable us to innovate empathetically and remain focused on the user.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Strategy
					</h2>
					<p>
						Equipped with our research findings, we are able to plan with our clients 
						the most effective path to get to market. Together, we look beyond the boundaries 
						of thinking in terms of features and functions and launch into considering the 
						real holistic needs of the people who will use the product. We employ a 
						combination of strategy tools that can vary according to specific project and 
						client needs. The result is that we establish meaningful user experience strategies 
						for our clients, success metrics, deliverables, and long-term governance.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Design
					</h2>
					<p>
						We create digital experiences for any platform that reflect your brand, vision, 
						and end-user needs. Taking the Research and Strategy findings, we start the iterative 
						design process. Through a variety of collaborative techniques we spark not only the 
						creation of individual screens but also generate a consistent and reusable design 
						language as we progress through interaction and visual design. Throughout all of this, 
						we keep the user at the center of every decision. This allows the synthesis of ideas 
						to encapsulate the entire user experience, beyond a single isolated product interaction, 
						and keep it as a set of actions, perceptions, feelings, and emotions that begins the 
						moment a user wakes up to the moment they go to sleep at night.
